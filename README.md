# Hate Speech Detection on Social Media using NLP techniques

> LSTM and BiLSTM hate speech detection

Using NLP techniques to parse and analyze tweets and determine if a tweet (sentence) contains hate speech or not

This is based on [t-davidson](https://github.com/t-davidson/hate-speech-and-offensive-language) finding offensive language on Twitter now known as 'X'.

The code classifies twitts (tiwtter text) using LSTM/BiLSTM inot hate speech or not. It consist on data analysis, data preprocessing (cleaning), model cross-validation.

We have collected our own tweets using Twitter Crawling tool which you can find in my repo: https://github.com/besjoncifliku/twitter-crawling-tool. It collects tweets based on keyword matches (scrapping Twitter API).
